    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>The human body is composed of several organs, each responsible for different functions. The action of these
        organs are governed by the most vital and critical organ known as 'brain'. The body cannot perform a single task
        without the signals being transmitted through the brain. Thus, it depends on the healthy state of this most
        important organ. There can be a situation where the brain stops functioning properly. One of the common reasons
        for this dysfunction is <b>'brain tumor'.</b>
        This project deals with a system that uses computer-based procedures to detect tumor blocks in the brain using
        <b>Convolution Neural Network Algorithm</b> for MRI images of different patients. Different types of image processing
        techniques like image segmentation, image enhancement and feature extraction are used for the brain tumor
        detection in the MRI images of the cancer-affected patients. Detection of brain tumor is done by using the
        following techniques: <b>Image pre-processing, Image segmentation, Feature extraction, and Classification.</b></p>
    <h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
    <p><b>One of the major advantages of this Brain Tumor Detection System is convenience and assurance.</b> In today's modern
        world where people can never be free from one or the other aspects of life demanding their attention leaving
        them little or no time to look after their health, if faced with such a deadly disease as a brain tumor, this
        system will allows individuals to get to know about the presence of a brain tumor on their own. Even if they
        have first consulted a doctor regarding their condition, a double-check via this system provides an assurance
        about the results. If the report is positive, the patient must get the necessary treatment at the earliest. If
        the report is negative, the person should feel encouraged to lead a healthier lifestyle.
    </p>
    <h3>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h3>
    <p>There has been a rapid development of Brain Tumor detection algorithms in the last few years. With the help of
        Machine Learning Algorithms the tumor can be detected by applying various techniques on the MRI scans of the
        brain.In training the model , we need a large amount of data set and for this purpose we used Kaggle . We used
        Google Collab as one can write,share and analyze the code all free over the browser.
        SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT :
    <ol>
        <li><b>Python</b> : It is the high level,interpreted programming language which was developed by Guido van Rossum.</li>
        <li><b>PIP</b> : It is the package management system for python which allows us to manage software packages written in
            python.</li>
        <li><b>NumPy</b> : It is the python library which provides tools to work on multidimensional arrays , matrices etc.
        </li>
        <li><b> Keras (with TensorFlow backend 2.3.0 version)</b> - It is a deep learning API used for implementing neural
            networks.</li>
        <li><b>Pandas</b> : It is the library provided by python used for manipulation and analysis of data .</li>
        <li><b>OpenCV</b>: It is the python library which helps us to perform image processing and computer vision tasks.</li>
        Here , we will use an automatic and reliable classification method Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as it
        helps us to identify every minute details.</li>
    </ol>
